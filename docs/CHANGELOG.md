## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
1. **Language System**: The app now uses a centralized translation system
   - Update any hardcoded text to use the translation function
   - Replace `t('key')` calls with the new translation system

2. **API Responses**: Some API endpoints now return different response formats
   - Update client-side code to handle new response structures
   - Check error handling for new error formats

3. **Database Schema**: Minor changes to database models
   - Run database migrations if needed
   - Update any direct database queries

#### Required Actions
1. **Environment Variables**: Add new environment variables
   ```env
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Update package.json dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible

#### Optional Improvements
1. **Customization**: Update translations in `lib/i18n.ts`
